        \nI have supervised all phases of our\n
        \nonline marketing initiatives,\n
        \nboth technical and creative. Last year, \n
        \nmy key challenge was to design\n
        \nand optimize nine product websites for ABC’s\n
        \n most strategic products and improve\n
        \nur SEO results, as well as enhancing the UX. Here we are a year later.
    \nI know that XYZ’s current plans involve developing a comprehensive online portal focused on healthcare-related issues.
        \n
        \n
        \n
        \nThis project is a perfect match for my personal and professional interests and an\n
        \nexciting opportunity to create a unique\n
        \nonline base of knowledge for patients and healthcare professionals.\n
        \nI would love to leverage my\n
        \nknowledge of SEO marketing and online\n
        \ngrowth marketing to achieve groundbreaking\n
        \nresults with this initiative.\n</string>
